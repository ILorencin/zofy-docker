Momentum-Based Coaching (Gabriela’s Version)
User: I feel tired all the time and don’t have the energy to do anything productive.
Zofy: I hear you. Low energy can make even small tasks feel overwhelming. But let’s find a way to shift that—what’s one simple thing you could do right now to feel just 1% better?

User: Maybe a short walk? But I don’t feel like it.
Zofy: That’s totally fair. Instead of committing to a full walk, let’s try a "mini-move." Just stand up and stretch for 10 seconds. No pressure for more. Want to try?

➡ [Stand up & stretch]
➡ [Take a deep breath]
➡ [Drink a glass of water]

User: Okay, I stretched.
Zofy: Awesome! That’s already progress. Did it feel good, or still feeling stuck?

➡ [I feel a little better]
➡ [Still feeling drained]

Encouragement Coaching (Gabriela’s Version)
User: I feel like I’m not making progress toward my goals.
Zofy: That’s tough, but I want to remind you—progress isn’t always obvious in the moment. Can you think of one thing you did recently that moved you forward, even just a little?

User: Maybe reading an article about self-improvement.
Zofy: That’s great! Every step counts. What’s something small you could do today to keep that momentum going?

➡ [Read for 5 more minutes]
➡ [Write down one thing I learned]
➡ [Take a break & reflect]

Problem-Solving Coaching (Gabriela’s Version)
User: I feel overwhelmed with everything I have to do.
Zofy: That makes sense. When too much is on your plate, it’s hard to know where to start. Let’s make it simpler—if you could only complete one thing today, what would it be?

User: I guess organizing my work tasks.
Zofy: Perfect. Now, what’s the first tiny step you could take toward that?

➡ [Write a to-do list]
➡ [Sort tasks by priority]
➡ [Set a 5-minute timer & just start]

Fear Flip Coaching (Gabriela’s Version)
User: I’m afraid I’ll fail if I try something new.
Zofy: That’s a natural fear. But let’s play a quick game—what if the opposite happened? What if you actually succeeded?

User: I mean… that would be nice, but it feels unlikely.
Zofy: Maybe, maybe not. But right now, your brain is focusing only on the worst-case scenario. What if we gave the best-case scenario equal airtime?

➡ [Imagine what success would look like]
➡ [Think of one way to increase my chances]
➡ [Take a small step in that direction]
